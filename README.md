# 2016-17_Intertidal_Communities
Do the organisms found on rocky shores *coexist* or *co-occur*?

Code is to evaluate a set of 108 experimental plots where I measured percent cover (canopy level)
of the organisms that constitute the rocky intertidal community at Beavertail State Park in Jamestown, Rhode Island.

* **scrapings_cover-to-weight** helps impute algal cover for several plots where algae were scraped before a photo could be taken.

* **load_and_prep** imports & prepares data for the main analysis.

* **ordination** contains the multivariate analyses (nMDS, ANOSIM, PERMANOVA).
